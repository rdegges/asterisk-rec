PURPOSE
=======

asterisk-rec aims to be a simple, pluggable Asterisk subroutine that allows you
to record sound files for usage in your system, in a dynamic and pragmatic way.

Let's say you are building an Asterisk service that allows callers to record
custom voicemail greetings. Typically, you'd have to write code to:

    - Record the greeting.
    - Verify that the new recording is acceptable, and should replace the
      current greeting.
    - Allow the caller to (optionally) switch back to their old greeting.

Depending on what you're trying to do, this could be a big burden, especially
when multiple versions of sound files are involved.

asterisk-rec allows you to outsource this logic in a clean manner, simply add
the following to your dialplan code, and you'll have the recording logic
embedded:

    ...
    exten => s,n,Gosub(rec,s,1(/path/to/recording.wav))
    exten => s,n,ExecIf($[ ${GOSUB_RETVAL} ]?Playback(success):Playback(failure))
    ...

Furthermore, asterisk-rec is fully customizable--so you can add your own custom
sound prompts if you don't like the defaults.
